# To Do List Application

This application provides basic to-do list functionality. You can create to-do lists in
which you have the ability to add, edit, delete and complete tasks.

# Creating a To-Do List

To create a To-Do List, enter a name into the text box location in the top-right
corner of the application. Once the name is entered, you may either press "Enter"
click the "New List" button to create the list. A window will pop up and you
will select the desired location of the to-do list. Your new to-do list will
be listed on the left side of the application.

# Adding items/tasks

To add a task, select a to-do list from the left side. The textbox on the top-left
of the right side of the application will be automatically focused. When you enter
text and press the "Enter" key or click the button with the "+" on it, a new
task will be added to the currently selected to-do list. The task will have a label
that shows the text that was entered into the aforementioned text field.

# Deleting items/tasks

To delete a task, right click on it in the right side of the application and click
"Delete" inside of the menu that pops up. The item you clicked on will be removed
from the to-do list.

To delete all tasks in the current to-do list, right click anywhere inside the
task list on the right side of the application and select "Delete All".

# Editing a items/tasks

To edit a task, left click on it to highlight it. The right-most text box on the
right side of the application will populate with that item's description and
highlight itself. You can make edits to the text inside that box. When done
editing, press "Enter" or click the "Save" button on the right side of the 
application to save your changes.

# Completing/Uncompleting items/tasks

To complete a task, right click the task on the right side of the application and
select "Toggle Complete". If the item was incompleted, it will be marked
as complete. If the item was already complete, it will be marked as incomplete.

# Filtering items/tasks

To filter items in the current to-do list, right click inside the
task list on the right side of the application and select either "Show Complete",
"Show Incomplete" or "Show All".

# Loading previous to-do lists

To load a previously opened to-do list, you can click its label on the left side
of the application. Once clicked, the list's items will be loaded on the right
side of the application.
